TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for
time-series data. It is engineered up from PostgreSQL, providing automatic
partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as well as full
SQL support.

TimescaleDB is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension and released under
the Apache 2 open-source license. [Contributors welcome.](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
