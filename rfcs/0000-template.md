# Summary

A summary of the feature, usually a single paragraph.

# Rationale

The motivation for the feature. It can include any of the sections
below, but does not have to.

## Situation

The current situation, typically with examples of how things currently
work. This is intended to give context to the problem description so
that it can easily be understood.

## Problem

The problem with the current situation, e.g., things that break,
things that make the solution hard to use, or things that affect
performance.

## Expected outcome

The goals, or expected outcome of the solution

# Reference-level description

The commands, their parameters, and any other description that would
go into a reference manual about the feature. Please include examples
of usage as well.

This part of the RFC is used by the documentation team to make sure
that the feature is properly documented, but is also a good
demonstration of how the feature would work and be used and hence good
material for discussing the design.

# Open Issues

Issues remaining to resolve either by incorporating them into the
design or discard them (with a reason for why). This section is
usually empty once the RFC is ready, but there is no strict
requirement that is has to be empty.

# Future work

Work that is not included, but which might be interesting to follow up
with in a future RFC.
