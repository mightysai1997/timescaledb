	 * It was actually implemented and didn't show any benefits in the preliminary
	 * testing, compared to what we already achieve with lazy decompression after
	 * vectorized filters. One reason is that the Postgres expression compiler
	 * can be eager in requesting materialization. For example, it would call
	 * slot_getattr up to the last attribute used by every filter in a qualifier,
