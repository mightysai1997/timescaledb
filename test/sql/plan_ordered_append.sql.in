-- we run these with analyze to confirm that nodes that are not
-- needed to fulfill the limit are not executed
-- unfortunately this doesn't work on PostgreSQL 9.6 which lacks
-- the ability to turn off analyze timing summary so we run
-- them without ANALYZE on PostgreSQL 9.6, but since LATERAL plans
-- are different across versions we need version specific output
-- here anyway.

-- look at postgres version to decide whether we run with analyze or without
