-- Note on testing: need a couple wrappers that pg_sleep in a loop to wait for changes
-- to appear in pg_stat_activity.
-- Further Note: PG 9.6 changed what appeared in pg_stat_activity, so the launcher doesn't actually show up.
-- we can still test its interactions with its children, but can't test some of the things specific to the launcher.
-- So we've added some bits about the version number as needed.
