# Please keep workflow- and tool-specific patters out of this
# file. Just put patterns here that are very generic and we want to
# avoid adding by mistake and files that are generated by the build
# system.
# 
# Comments from gitignore(1) mention that which file to place a
# pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used:
#
# * Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to
#   other repositories via clone (i.e., files that all developers will
#   want to ignore) should go into a .gitignore file.
#
# * Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which
#   do not need to be shared with other related repositories (e.g.,
#   auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific
#   to one user’s workflow) should go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude
#   file.
#
# * Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g.,
#   backup or temporary files generated by the user’s editor of
#   choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in
#   the user’s ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is
#   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set
#   or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.
