-- time_bucket_ng() is an _experimental_ new version of time_bucket().
--
-- Unlike time_bucket(), time_bucket_ng() supports variable-sized buckets,
-- such as months and years, and also timezones. Note that the behavior
-- and the interface of this function are subjects to change. There could
-- be bugs, and the implementation doesn't claim to be complete. Use at
-- your own risk.
--
-- This function is IMMUTABLE when it doesn't accept timestamptz arguments,
-- and STABLE otherwise. The reason is that occasionally timezones change.
-- When dealing with timestamptz's from the far future, it's possible that
-- between now and then the rules for given TZ will change by local laws. Which
-- makes the function STABLE by the definition [1].
--
-- We don't forbid users to work with timestamptz's from the future, nor warn
-- about this corner case. This behavior is consistent with PostgreSQL
-- behavior [2].
